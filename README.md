A dynamic and interactive quiz application built using React, based on Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s Ultimate React Course on Udemy.

Features:

Responsive quiz interface with real-time score updates

Countdown timer for each question (if implemented)

State management with useReducer (if used in your version)

Clean and modular code structure

Fully responsive and styled with CSS
